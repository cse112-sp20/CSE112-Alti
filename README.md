# Alti
Transitioning in and out of your daily work routine can be hard. Especially when you're working from home, an environment you typically associate with leisure and relaxation, your brain can find it difficult to jump head first into the complex problems you were solving the previous work day. On the other hand, when you're relaxing at home with your family after work hours, your brain is constantly fighting the urge to return back to your work to crunch out a few more tasks for your upcoming deadline, especially knowing your "workspace" is constantly setup in the comfort of your home.

When youâ€™re working from home, the lines become blurred between what your brain thinks is personal relaxation time (family, friends, hobbies, etc.) and productive work time where you are 100% dedicated to the task at hand.

To combat this problem, Alti brings your team a unique solution that helps you efficiently "warm up" and "cool down" in and out of your work routine to ensure productivity during work hours, and regret-free relaxation with your family during your downtime.
